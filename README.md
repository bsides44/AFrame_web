# AFrame_web
Demonstrating appless, browser-based webXR with A-Frame and AR.js for my business card.

3D Model appears on a flat surface with a realistic shadow-receiving plane. 3D model was created using Reality Capture and animated with Mixamo.

AR.js is added to A-Frame to leverage the 3D capabilities of A-Frame into an AR environment. 

To run:
cd AFrame_web
npm install -g live-server && live-server to serve locally
control+C to end live-server
